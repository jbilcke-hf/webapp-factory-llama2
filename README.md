A minimalist Docker project to generate web apps on demand using Llama2.

Note: this is for demonstration only: this endpoint isn't supposed to be duplicated, as it uses a private Hugging Face Inference Endpoint.

# Examples

```
http://localhost:7860/?prompt=A%20simple%20page%20to%20compute%20the%20BMI%20(use%20SI%20units)
